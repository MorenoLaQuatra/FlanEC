# Exploring Flan-T5 for Post-ASR Error Correction

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper "Exploring Flan-T5 for Post-ASR Error Correction". The project investigates the use of the Flan-T5 model for Generative Speech Error Correction (GenSEC) to enhance ASR outputs by mapping n-best hypotheses into a single, accurate transcription.

## Description

The full code and detailed documentation will be made available upon the acceptance of the paper.
